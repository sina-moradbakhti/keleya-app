# Getting Start

For starting the app first we need to install `Flutter` on your machine, then go to the project path using `cmd` and run the command `flutter pub get` and at last `flutter run --no-sound-null-safety`.

- Flutter version : `2.2.3 (stable channel)`
- Dart version : `2.2.0`

<br/>

```
cd Desktop/keleya-app
flutter pub get
flutter run --no-sound-null-safety
```

> just note that for starting the app you should open a simulator such as iOS or android emulator before you start otherwise flutter will try to open the app via Google Chrome automatically and it would maybe messy on the browser.


## Summary

The app made in 6 working days although it could be done after 3 days, but I did more time on the project since to have maximum quality of code and readbility.

The main framework which I used to handle the states in the other world the state managment platform is `Redux` because I think the Redux can be more scalable in Flutter rather than other frameworks such as MVC, MVVM, Provider and Bloc.

There was no any problem while coding this project as I saied already I've extensive experience in mobile app development specially in Flutter framework.
